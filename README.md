# This is the repo for Qrux's website

A personal project of mine not related to academics or even technology! If you want the template, feel free to clone the repo. 

If you are working on the project with me, read on:
Please create a clone of the dev branch on your local machines. Commit and push all changes to *the dev branch only* and create a merge request. 

In the dev branch, please explain the new commits well so that it is easier for us to go back and fix things later.
I recommend using VS Code(or another code editor) along with Git/GitHub extensions to streamline workflow. The video below may be of some help:
